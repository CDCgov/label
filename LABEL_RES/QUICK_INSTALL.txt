HARDWARE.
We recommend a single multi-core machine with no fewer than 2 cores (8 to 12 cores work best) and at least 4 GB of RAM.  LABEL runtime is impacted by the number of cores available on a machine. Use with Mac OS X requires a 64 bit chipset.

SOFTWARE PRE-REQUISITES.
+ Linux or Mac OS X (tested on Snow Leopard, Lion; CentOS 5.8, 6.2 & Ubuntu 12)
 - BASH version 3 or later
 - Standard utilities: sleep, cut, paste, jobs, zip, env, cat, cp, getopts.
 - License: GPL (any)
+ Perl version 5 or later (tested 5.12.3)
 - Standard includes: Getopt::Long, File::Basename
 - License: GPL (any)

INSTALLATION.
1) Unzip the archive containing LABEL.
2) Move the file "LABEL" and the directory "LABEL_RES" to a place in your PATH environment variable.  Otherwise, add the directory containing LABEL and LABEL_RES to your PATH.
3) Restart your terminal emulator. Note: LABEL_RES and LABEL must be in the same folder.
4) LABEL is now installed.  To test it, execute: LABEL test.fa test_project H9v2011
5) The file "test.fa" is given in the deployment archive. To access LABEL without using the PATH variable, cd to your extracted directory & substitute "./LABEL" for "LABEL" above.
